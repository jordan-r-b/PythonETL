# PythonETL
Extracting data from multiple files, parsing into required input, and writing files with input in Python for data loading.

Business problem: Multiple txt files are outputted from devices and sent to a designated folder. These files contain strings of numbers representing multiple fields of data. String has a set pattern but is not always consistent which requires built in data checking. Need to extract data and convert into a flat file for use with a different service. Key field in the data needs to be matched with a seperate data source for final field in flat file. 

PythonETL 1.0

Original python script without example file formats. Will include examples in future.
